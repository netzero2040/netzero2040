The Python package **pyam** is an open-source community toolbox
for analysis & visualization of scenario data.
It was developed to facilitate working with timeseries data
conforming to the format developed by the IAMC,
and it is used in ongoing assessments by the IPCC and in many model comparison
projects at the global and national level, including several Horizon 2020 projects.
